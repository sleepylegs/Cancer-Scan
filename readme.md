# CancerScan - Brain MRI Classifier

![CancerScan Logo](cancer_scan_mri.jpeg)

CancerScan is an AI-powered web application designed to classify brain MRI scans. It helps in identifying the presence and type of brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary) or indicating the absence of a tumor. This tool provides quick, preliminary insights based on machine learning predictions, aiming to assist in early detection and understanding of MRI results.

## Features

* **Intuitive Image Upload:** Easily upload brain MRI images via drag-and-drop or a click-to-upload button.

* **Real-time Preview:** Instantly view the uploaded MRI scan within the application.

* **AI-Powered Classification:** Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to classify MRI scans into one of four categories:

    * **Glioma**

    * **Meningioma**

    * **No Tumor**

    * **Pituitary**

* **Confidence Score:** Displays the confidence level of the AI's prediction.

* **AI Review & Next Steps:** Provides general insights and recommendations based on the classification result.

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web application.

* **CSS3:** Custom styling using the Poppins font for a modern and clean user interface.

* **JavaScript:** Powers the interactive elements, image handling, and communication with the AI model.

* **Roboflow.js:** A JavaScript library used for integrating and running the pre-trained machine learning model directly in the browser.

## Usage

1.  **Upload Image:** Click the "Click to Upload" button or drag and drop your brain MRI image into the designated area.

2.  **View Prediction:** The uploaded image will be displayed, and the AI will process it. The prediction result and a confidence score will appear under the "Prediction" section.

3.  **Read AI Review:** Get general insights and next steps based on the AI's classification in the "AI Review & Next Steps" section.
