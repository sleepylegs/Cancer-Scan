![CancerScan Logo](cancer_scan_mri.jpeg)

CancerScan is an AI-powered web application designed to classify brain MRI scans. It helps in identifying the type of brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary) or indicate the absence of them.
This tool provides quick, preliminary insights based on machine learning predictions, aiming to assist in early detection and understanding of MRI results. The model was pre-trained on roboflow and implemented on our own website using their api.
